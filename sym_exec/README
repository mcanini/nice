The PySE (Python Symbolic Execution)
=====================================

nox : contains the the small subset of the NOX library/framework API needed to run apps inside the SE.
      Some files are taken from the original library and modified as needed
symbolic : the Python symbolic engine
examples : unmodified NOX apps known to work

To execute:
-----------
sym_exec.py <path-to-noxapp.py>

The -o switch can be used to change the output directory. By default it is $cwd/output.
